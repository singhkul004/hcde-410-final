# Academic Pressure and Study Satisfaction Analysis

This project explores how academic pressure affects study satisfaction among students, shedding light on its role in mental health outcomes like depression. By identifying actionable insights, the study aims to guide educators and policymakers in creating healthier learning environments.

## Who Is This For?
- **Educators** interested in improving student well-being.
- **Policymakers** aiming to implement data-driven changes in academic systems.
- **Researchers** exploring connections between education and mental health.

## Dataset
This project uses the Depression Student Dataset from Kaggle, containing 502 entries with variables such as academic pressure, study satisfaction, and depression status. All data is anonymized and sourced under open licensing for public research use.

---

## Methodology
We started with visualizations (histograms and box plots) to understand the dataset, followed by statistical analyses like Pearson correlation and regression modeling. The focus was on ensuring the results were clear, actionable, and unbiased.

---

## Key Findings
The analysis highlights a weak but statistically significant negative correlation between academic pressure and study satisfaction. These results suggest that higher academic pressure slightly reduces satisfaction, underscoring the importance of balanced academic demands.


---

## Limitations
- The dataset is relatively small (502 entries), which may limit generalizability.
- Variables like "academic pressure" are self-reported and subjective, which could introduce bias.
- The study does not establish causation, only correlation.

---

## Ethical Considerations
- Data is anonymized and open-source to protect participant privacy.
- Findings aim to support students' well-being through actionable recommendations for educators and policymakers.
- Analysis was conducted with fairness in mind, avoiding overgeneralizations or unsupported causal claims.

## Reproducing the Analysis
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook file `analysis.ipynb` in a Python environment.
4. Dataset file `depression_student_data.csv` is included in the repository.

---

## Next Steps
- Use the insights to design educational programs that reduce unnecessary academic pressure.
- Extend the analysis by incorporating larger, more diverse datasets.
- Explore additional variables, such as coping mechanisms or external support systems, to deepen the findings.
