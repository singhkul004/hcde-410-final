This project investigates the literacy levels of adults in the U.S. and how these levels influence their ability to effectively engage with AI applications. By analyzing the *National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL) 2003 dataset, we explore the relationship between demographic factors such as age, education, and race, and the literacy required to use AI systems effectively. This analysis aims to uncover the extent of literacy gaps that may limit access to AI tools and inform the design of more inclusive AI interfaces. The results will help identify which demographic groups are most at risk of being excluded from the benefits of AI.
